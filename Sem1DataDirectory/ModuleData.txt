The focus is on how accounting can help investors make better decisions. Book-keeping and preparation of financial statements are also covered at an introductory level, as investors need to be aware of how the financial statements are derived.
CS1231|Discrete Structures|This module introduces mathematical tools required in the study of computer science. Topics include: (1) Logic and proof techniques: propositions, conditionals, quantifications.  (2) Relations and Functions: Equivalence relations and partitions.  Partially ordered sets.  Well-Ordering Principle. Function equality.  Boolean/identity/inverse functions.  Bijection. (3) Mathematical formulation of data models (linear model, trees, graphs). (4) Counting and Combinatoric: Pigeonhole Principle. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.  Number of relations on a set, number of injections from one finite set to another, Diagonalisation proof: An infinite countable set has an uncountable power set; Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset.  Subsets of countable sets are countable.
